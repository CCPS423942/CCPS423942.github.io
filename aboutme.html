    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards becoming an author and book editor in my personal and professional life. I am striving for these goals by reading or writing every day. In middle school, I cowrote a short story compilation with a friend. This project, along with writing additional short stories helped practice my skills and gave me valuable experience in collaboration. The experiences that led me here were reading incredible books since my early childhood and realizing the impact they had on young readers. This inspired me to try my hand at creative writing and I found it was something I enjoyed doing. I have been practicing creative writing for about five years. As time passes, I notice myself getting better at the craft. The values I consider most necessary for my success are optimism, diligence, and imagination. I believe this combination of values can help anyone achieve great things. Some short-term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future are continuing to get good grades in high school in order to go to college and finishing the first draft of my book. The character traits and achievements I want to be most known for are being a hardworking and attentive student. I hope to improve at using the brief free moments of time I have throughout high school to progress towards my career/academic goals.</p>
